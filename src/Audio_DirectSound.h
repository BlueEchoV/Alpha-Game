// SAMPLE: In audio programming, a sample is a tiny snapshot of sound taken 
//		   at a specific moment in time. Think of it like a single frame in a 
//		   movie—it’s just one small piece of the audio that, when combined with 
//		   many other samples, creates the full sound you hear, like a song or a voice.

// 1) Have a buffer to store the sound
